    "## Define the Following:\n",
    "You can add image, diagrams, whatever you need to ensure that you understand the concepts below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Layer:\n",
    "The input layer is the part of our data that the neural network is exposed to and interacts with. Each input node is typically assigned to one feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hidden Layer:\n",
    "The magic of modern neural networks; any layer between input and output layer. The data can not be accessed or directly interact with in this layer. It is passed through obscured to the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Layer:\n",
    "The output layer puts vector values suitable to the type of problem we're trying to assess (regression, classification, etc). They have a node for each type of output (for example, binary classification will have a single output node (probability)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neuron:\n",
    "Neurons / Nodes receive inputs and pass on the signal to the next layer of nodes if a certain threshold is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weight:\n",
    "The weight gives us the range of motion to move up and down the equation. Each step along the way, each layer affects the next layer by using the weighted sum of our inputs (plus bias). One way to think of weights is the strength of connection between nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activation Function:\n",
    "Activation functions determine how much signal is sent from the previous layer to the next. Hidden and output layers may contain activation functions, while input layers don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node Map:\n",
    "A node map is a visual diagram that serves as a representation of the neural network's architecture. They are used because the equations to represent the neural network are so complicated that it would be painstakingly hard to read and interpret what is going on within them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perceptron:\n",
    "A perceptron is the simplest version of a neural network. It's a single node with nothing else but the input. It will take the inputs, calculate with weight, sum up all predictions, then pass the sum to the activation function. The result of this will be our final value."
